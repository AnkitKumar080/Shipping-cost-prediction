# Shipping-cost-prediction

Built a Machine Learning model to predict the cost required to ship sculptures to customers and create an effective collection management system.
The dataset is obtained from kaggle. Performed EDA, preprocessing, build different models and did hyperparameter tuning using RandomisedSearch CV to find the best model.
